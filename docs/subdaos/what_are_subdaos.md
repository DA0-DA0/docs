# What are SubDAOs?

SubDAOs allow DAOs to build more complex organizational structures. A SubDAO is a DAO that has another DAO as it's admin, implying a heirachical power relationship. The SubDAO admin has the ability to execute any message on behalf of the SubDAO, including spending it's treasury, managing members, pausing the SubDAO, or executing a smart contract message through it.

You can use SubDAOs to build teams, groups, deparments, committees, advisory boards, and more!

How you design your organization is up to you. If you're looking for an example, [The Corporation](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1xd2fed839exdvqfa4nqluyxxclvwul7kd48e9pyfm0z2g90dc37srnqy39/proposals) leverages SubDAOs heavily, and demonstrates that it's possible to create a C-Corp like structure using DAO DAO.
