# Congratulations!

You've created your own DAO. More importantly, you've learned the basics of DAO DAO.

DAO DAO has **much more to offer**. By taking full advantage of proposal actions, you can create extremely simple or fascinatingly complex governance systems. The limits are your imagination and your ability to organize! Check out the `Recipes` section for more information.

One of the most important next steps to governing successful communities on DAO DAO is learning [how to design your DAO securely](https://medium.com/@dao-dao/best-security-practices-for-daos-59484932377f). While we build DAO DAO to be powerful and composable, it is easy to shoot yourself in the foot. A great place to double check your assumptions and discuss ideas with others before managing sensitive assets is [our Discord server](https://discord.daodao.zone).
