# Making Use of Storage Items

Storage items are key-value pairs that are stored through the DAO governance process. These are designed to provide a source of truth for any content a DAO might want. 

## Example of Storage Items In Use 
- **Address Authentication**: wallet or contracts may be verified through DAO governance and stored as an item to create an easy retrieval of potential crucial address or contracts.
- **Record Keeping**: storage items can be made of use as a journal or sorts, logging entries chronologically.
- **Experimental**: get creative with your DAOs storage!
