# Contribute to DAO DAO!

DAO DAO rewards the people who contribute to it.

The first step is to join the community! We generally hang out in Discord\
([invite link](https://discord.daodao.zone), be sure to complete the\
verification process).

Anyone can contribute, and contributions are not limited to code. Design, bug\
reports, research, educational materials, translations, and being helpful to\
other users with questions are all contributions, and are all eligible for\
rewards!

Want to get started? [Learn about our retroactive rewards program\
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WpREOPrvhW3YVxGLoOkrhTgf_bDUy4cn9VKeyH4PUY/edit).

{% hint style="info" %}
DAO DAO's contributor compensation system is temporarily paused while we figure\
out our legal plans. For the time being, keep track of your contributions\
yourself. We fully intend on restarting our system in the near future.
