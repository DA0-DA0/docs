# Contributor guidelines

DAO DAO exists because of contributors! Initial $DAO tokens were distributed to these contributors. However, it was impossible to include everyone in the first drop. Going forward, we will periodically recognize more contributors and drop tokens to them!

This document describes how to contribute and be recognized for contributions.

## How to become a contributor?

First step is to join the community! We generally hangout in [Discord](https://discord.gg/zUPyBcjp5T)
>Here is the [invite link](https://discord.gg/zUPyBcjp5T). Be sure to complete the verification process.

### There are many ways to become contributor:

#### Code
>If you are a developer and want to contribute, you can find good first issues to work on. Click on [DAO Contracts](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/labels/good-first-issue) or [DAO Indexer](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-indexer/labels/good%20first%20issue) to find an issue to work on now. Want to contribute to front-end? Find a [DAO DAO UI](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-dao-ui/labels/good-first-issue) issue.

#### Design
>Interested in design? Start by checking out the [Design](https://discord.gg/cBvV7CW5A8) channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zUPyBcjp5T).

#### QA and Bug Reporting
>Try out [DAO DAO Testnet](https://testnet.daodao.zone/), and report back on any bugs you find.

#### Contributing Clear, Concise, and Helpful Documentation
>DAO DAO is growing and making upgrades regularly, and the documentation needs to stay current. If you want to contribute, here are good first-time [Docs](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/docs/labels/good%20first%20issue) issues.

#### Educational Materials (e.g. contributing to this repo!)
>We welcome people to get involved, learn, and bring their own know-how to DAO DAO.


#### Translations
>DAO DAO is expanding and growing worldwide, and we want to be accessible to everyone. If you are able and willing to translate, we would love your help.

The best way to get started on these would be to join [Discord](https://discord.gg/zUPyBcjp5T) and check out the taskforces that interest you. Look for the ```interview-taskforce``` channel there, as well as many others. Feel free to ask questions, and a contributor will be happy to help you, if needed.

*Note that financial donations are not on this list. Contributions are donations of labor to make DAO DAO better at achieving its mission, including contributions that make the interchain stronger overall.*

## How to get recognized

Each month, anyone who has contributed to the project in the past month will fill out a form detailing their contributions. Following this, the DAO DAO Development Fund (a group of core DAO DAO contributors) will review the responses and vote on token allocations for the contributions.

To prevent spam and unwanted DMs to DAO DAO members, we have one rule: **no asking for DAO tokens**.

We do not take proposals, but rather recognize work after it has been completed.

No need to ask permission to contribute, just do it!

## How to contribute to the DAO DAO Repos
