# Telegram Notifications

Setting up Telegram notifications takes 60 seconds.

1.  Start by navigating to https://t.me/dao\_dao\_notifier\_bot and tapping the`Start` button at the bottom.

    \
    On Mobile:

    <div data-full-width="false"><img src="../../static/img/notifications/tg-start-mobile.jpg" alt="Telegram Mobile" width="188"></div>

    On Desktop:

    ![Telegram Desktop](../../static/img/notifications/tg-start-desktop.png)
2.  Once you tap the `Start` button, you should see instructions for tracking a\
    DAO.

3.  If you'd like to track DAOs with other people, add the bot to a group chat by tapping its name at the top of the screen and then tapping the `Add to Group or Channel` button at the bottom. When adding the bot to a group, it may ask if you want to make it an admin. You do _**NOT**_ need to do this. Adding it as a regular member is sufficient. Also, it runs in privacy mode, so it can't read any of your\
    messages. If you just want private notifications, skip this step.

4.  Once the bot is in the chat where you want to receive notifications, just send the command shown in the instructions to start tracking a DAO. You can also paste the entire DAO URL from your browser instead of typing the address manually.

    ```
    /add@dao_dao_notifier_bot DAO_ADDRESS
    ```

    On Desktop:

    ![Telegram Desktop](../../static/img/notifications/tg-add-desktop.png)
5. Now you're done! When new proposals are created, the bot will message you\
   right away. If you added the bot to a group, everyone in the group will start receiving\
   notifications. If you added the bot to a private chat, you'll be the only one receiving\
   notifications. You can track additional DAOs by sending the same command from any chat that\
   the bot is in.
