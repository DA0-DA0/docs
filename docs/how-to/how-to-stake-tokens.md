# How to stake tokens

You can stake tokens on the DAO's home chain and any chain that the DAO has
created a [cross-chain account](/how-to/how-to-manage-cross-chain-tokens) on.

## Steps

[Create a proposal](/how-to/how-to-create-a-proposal) and add the `Manage
Staking` action from the `DAO Treasury` category.

You can choose any token native to the chains the DAO has accounts on. If you
want to stake tokens on a chain that the DAO does not have an account on, you
have to [create a cross-chain account](/how-to/how-to-manage-cross-chain-tokens)
on that chain first.

Once this proposal is passed and executed, the tokens will be staked.

## Other staking options

Aside from staking, you can also unstake, restake, claim rewards, and change the
rewards withdrawal address.

### Changing the rewards withdrawal address

You can change the rewards withdrawal address to a wallet or DAO other than the
DAO itself. This may be useful if you have a SubDAO that you want to receive
staking rewards instead.
