# Create your first proposal

After [creating a DAO for your book club](/quickstart/create-a-dao), I'm sure
you're busy telling all of your friends to download Leap so they can join you.
Once they join your DAO, why don't we make a governance proposal for everyone to
vote on?

Let's create a proposal to decide what book to read.

:::note

If you create a proposal before your friends join, they won't be able to vote on
it since they won't have registered to vote in time. Make sure that everyone has
joined the DAO before making your proposal.

## Crafting your proposal

Since you were the first one here, it's only fair that you suggest what everyone
read next. Let's create a proposal suggesting the group read Murray Bookchin's
_The Next Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy_.

To begin, starting from your DAO's page, navigate to **Proposals > New
Proposal**.

Then, fill in the proposal's name and description.

:::tip Actions?

You'll notice the `Actions` label there. [Proposal
actions](/definitions/proposals#actions) allow you to add rich functionality to
proposals: software instructions that execute on the blockchain when a proposal
is passed and executed.

The proposal we are creating is a social agreement, so we don't need to run any
code.

:::

## Ship it!

Now that we're ready, go ahead and press **Publish**. Your wallet will prompt
you to approve the transaction.

Once you approve it, you'll see that your proposal is live!

Now that we've made a proposal, let's [vote on it](/quickstart/voting).
