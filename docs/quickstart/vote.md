# Voting

Now that everyone has [joined the DAO](./joining.md) and a proposal
has [been made](./create-a-proposal.md) you can vote on it!

### Vote yes!

Go ahead and vote *yes* on your new proposal and approve the
transaction in Keplr. Once your fellow DAO members vote as well the
proposal will pass or fail depending on what everyone thinks of the
book. :)
