# Joining your DAO

To join a DAO DAO DAO you must "register to vote" by staking your
governance tokens with the DAO. Once you are registered to vote you
can vote on all future proposals, but you cant go back and vote on
proposals that were created before you registered.

To register to vote visit your DAO's page on DAO DAO and look in the
right sidebar:

From here you can press the "Stake tokens" button and a modal will
appear asking you how many you'd like to stake:

By staking your tokens you are registering those tokens for
voting. Any tokens you do not stake won't count towards your voting
power. If you want your votes to matter as much as possible, you'll
likely want to stake all of them. :)

There are some rare situations where you may not want to stake all of
your tokens. For example:

1. Some DAOs require that some tokens are deposited to create a
   proposal. If you plan on making a proposal you may leave one
   deposit worth of tokens unstaked.
2. Some DAOs have an unstaking duration which is the amount of time
   you must wait between unstaking your tokens and those tokens being
   avaliable to you. If you are holding DAO tokens as an investment in
   a DAO with a non-zero unstaking duration you may consider leaving
   some unstaked.

Here's a little drawing of the process of joining a DAO for the more
visual folks out there:
