# Upgrading a multisig

:::tip

There are newer versions available. You must first upgrade to V1, and then
follow the newer upgrade instructions to get to the most recent version.

:::

To upgrade a beta multisig to a v1 multisig:

1. Create a new proposal.
2. Press the `Add Component +` button and select the `ðŸ¦¢ Upgrade to V1`
   template.

The template will then walk you through the steps to migrate to your new V1
multisig. After you fill out the template, make sure to double check that the
new multisig is configured correctly.

A good way of testing that your new multisig is correct is to make a new
proposal in the new one called `Acceptance of V1 multisig`. Then, have members
vote on the proposal. If everyone votes and the proposal passes, it's a good
sign that your multisig is configured correctly.

## Why upgrade

By upgrading from beta to V1, you'll continue to receive new feature releases
from DAO DAO and start using
[audited](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/releases/tag/v1.0.0) smart
contracts.

Beta DAOs and multisigs have been moved to
[legacy.daodao.zone](https://legacy.daodao.zone) and no longer receive new
feature releases.
