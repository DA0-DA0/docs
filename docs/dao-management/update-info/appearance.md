# Update DAO Appearance
Once your DAO has been created, any changes to its appearance, name, or description will need to be done through a proposal and vote. 
## 1. Create Proposal
a. From your DAO page, example circled in green, click the Proposal tab, indicated by the yellow arrow.

c. Give your proposal a title and description.

Voting parameters, shown at the bottom of the above photo, are also set at DAO creation and would need a separate proposal to be changed.

## 2. Vote
a. Once the proposal is live, you and other DAO members can vote. If the majority of votes have been cast and the outcome of the vote is decided, the vote can be ended early via the execute button found on the proposal's page.

b. If the DAO membership votes in favor of the appearance change, the change will happen automatically at the close of the voting period.
