c. Under Grantee address, paste an Osmosis address or search for an account or DAO already on DAO DAO. This will be the party having Authz Exec privileges revoked.

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, the DAO is revoking authrizations to stake, unstake, redelegate and vote. They are also granting these same authorizations to an individual account in the same proposal. This means the proposal has a total of eight actions, indicated with the green circle in the image above.
{% endhint %}

d. At the bottom of the screen will be an option to publish your proposal. Once you have reviewed your changes, publish your proposal to start the vote!

## 3. Vote

a. Once the proposal is live, you and other DAO members can vote. [Learn more about voting here!](../../dao-governance/proposals/how-to-vote-on-a-proposal)

b. If the DAO membership votes in favor of the proposal, all of the change will happen automatically at the close of the voting period.
