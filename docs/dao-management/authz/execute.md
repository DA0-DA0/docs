This guide outlines how to use authorized privileges (via Authz Exec) as an\

## Individual Account

### 2. Authz Exec

a. A new window for Authz Exec actions will populate. First paste the Osmosis address for the DAO you which you act on behalf of or search for it by name.

b. This account was granted privileges to stake, unstake, and restake on behalf of the DAO in [Grant Authz Exec](grant/), thus it may perform any of these actions autonomously with the DAO's treasury funds.

### 3. Execute :key:

b. If the DAO membership votes in favor of the proposal, all of the change will happen automatically at the close of the voting period.
