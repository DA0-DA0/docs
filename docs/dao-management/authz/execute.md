# Execute via Authorization

This guide outlines how to use authorized privileges (via Authz Exec) as an
individual account or a DAO/SubDAO.

## Individual Account

### 1. Initiate Action

a. From the [home page](daodao.zone), select the Actions tab, indicated by the green arrow in the picture below.

### 2. Authz Exec

a. A new window for Authz Exec actions will populate. First paste the Osmosis address for the DAO you which you act on behalf of or search for it by name.

b. This account was granted privileges to stake, unstake, and restake on behalf of the DAO in [Grant Authz Exec](../grant-authz-exec.md), thus it may perform any of these actions autonomously with the DAO's treasury funds.
