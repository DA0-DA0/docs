# Enable Vesting Payments
This feature allows DAOs to set up vesting contracts. A vesting payment distributes funds according to any schedule you choose, and the DAO can enable or disable early cancelation.

To create vesting payments, you must first create a vesting payment manager on each chain that you want to pay from, and the DAO must have an account on each chain before you can create the manager. 
## 1. Create a new proposal
a. From your DAO page, select the Proposal tab and click the +Proposal button.

## 2. Vote
a. Once the proposal is live, you and other DAO members can vote. If the majority of votes have been cast and the outcome of the vote is decided, the vote can be ended early via the execute button found on the proposal's page.
b. If the DAO membership votes in favor of enabling vesting payments, the feature will be automatically enabled at the close of the voting period.
