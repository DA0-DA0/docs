# How to act on behalf of a SubDAO

As discussed in [What are SubDAOs?](what), the admin (or parent DAO) can execute any action on behalf of the SubDAO. Follow this guide or [watch our video guide](https://youtu.be/T8P8TFOU_kU) to learn how.

In the parent DAO, create a new proposal and add the `DAO Admin Execute` action from the `DAO Governance` category.

Once you pass and execute the proposal, your action(s) will be executed on behalf of the SubDAO.
