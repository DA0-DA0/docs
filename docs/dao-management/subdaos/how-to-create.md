# How to create a SubDAO

Creating a SubDAO is as easy as creating a regular DAO, with one extra step at the end!

To start, go to the DAO you want to create a SubDAO for, and navigate to **SubDAOs > New SubDAO**.

You will be brought to an interface that looks identical to the interface for creating a DAO, except the header should contain the name of the parent DAO.

Create the SubDAO like you would any other DAO. If you need help, check out
[Create your first DAO](..../introduction/quickstart/create-a-dao.md) in the Quickstart section.

Lastly, the parent DAO needs to recognize the SubDAO with a proposal. This security step prevents anyone from creating a SubDAO of an organization and pretending to be a part of it.

Check out our YouTube for video guide for [adding]((https://youtu.be/F42qF2mAYxU)) or [removing](https://youtu.be/qpP_WSiju2U) a subDAO from the parent DAO!

If you are a member of the parent DAO, you can click on the banner at the top of the SubDAO's home page to open the parent DAO's proposal creation page with the action prefilled.

Clicking the alert banner at the top of the page will take you here:

Once the parent DAO passes and executes this proposal, the SubDAO will be recognized!

And it will show up in the parent DAO's SubDAOs tab!
