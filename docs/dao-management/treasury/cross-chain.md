# Manage cross-chain tokens

By default, you can manage tokens on the DAO's home chain. You may also want to hold, spend, and stake tokens on other chains.

The first step is to [set up a cross-chain account](https://youtu.be/D4oiQl1Ne7k) on each chain you want to manage tokens on.

[Watch a video on managing cross-chain tokens!](https://youtu.be/5LSe48BcTyk)

## Setup

[Create a proposal](../../dao-governance/proposals/how-to-create-a-proposal) and add the `Create Cross-Chain Account` action from the `DAO Treasury` category.

Simply select which chain you want to create an account on. You can even add multiple chains at once using the plus button on the right.

Once this proposal is passed and executed, the cross-chain accounts will be created. This may take a few minutes as chain relayers have to detect and relay the actions to the other chains.

## Sending tokens to a cross-chain account

Once you have created cross-chain accounts, they will appear in the `Treasury & NFTs` tab of the DAO's page.

Click on the address to the right of the chain you want to send tokens to in order to copy it. Just send tokens from your wallet to the corresponding address on the desired chain, and your DAO will receive them.

## Spending cross-chain tokens

Spending cross-chain tokens is as easy as spending on the DAO's home chain.

Check out the [How to send tokens](./send) guide to get started.

When you select the token you want to send, you will see a list of all tokens on all chains the DAO has an account on.

## Staking cross-chain tokens and earning rewards

Earning cross-chain staking rewards is as easy as staking on the DAO's home chain.

Check out the [How to stake tokens](./staking) guide to get started.

You can change the token you're going to stake in the action.
