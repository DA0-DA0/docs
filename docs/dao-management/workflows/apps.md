DAO Apps is a tab in all DAOs for members to interact with web-applications and propose for actions to broadcasted as a DAO.

## Why use DAO Apps?
- **Familiar UX:** Navigating through apps as a DAO provides a very close experience to interacting with apps as a single wallet, from your browser.
- **Pre Propose Approver:** [Explained in detail here](../../dao-governance/proposals/proposal-approver#2-approving-proposals), a DAO serving as a pre-proposal approver can use DAO apps for the approver workflow.
