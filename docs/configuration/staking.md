# Staking

Token-based and NFT-based DAOs can configure the parameters of their staking
process.

Staking parameters are initially set when you create a DAO. Of course you can
always modify them later with a [governance proposal](/definitions/proposals)
containing the `Update Staking Config` action from the `DAO Governance`
category.

## Unstaking duration

After someone stakes tokens in a DAO, those tokens cannot be immediately
unstaked. The unstaking duration is how long they remain locked after deciding
to unstake. During the unstaking process, they do _not_ count towards your
voting power, and you cannot transfer them.

This adds a time cost to staking and ensures a greater level of participatory
commitment from members.
