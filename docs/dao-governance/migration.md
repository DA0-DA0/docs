# Migration

There is no standardized migration process for DAOs since configurations can vary significantly, especially across chains.

It's best practice to create a new DAO and formulate a well-structured migration plan that you communicate to the community. A migration plan should include:

* Reasons outlining the need for the migration
* The timeline for the migration
* How voting power will be transferred
* Security measures that will be taken

## Key considerations

As people migrate, voting power will be decreasing in the original DAO. This may present a security risk if insufficient voting power is held in the original DAO to vote down malicious proposals, especially if voting power can be purchased on a market.

Some potential solutions include:

* Implementing a migration committee entrusted with the DAO's assets during the migration period
* Creating a security council that can veto malicious proposals in either/both DAOs
* Creating a security council that must approve all proposals in either/both DAOs before they open for voting

As always, be very careful and intentional about the migration process, especially when there are assets at stake.
