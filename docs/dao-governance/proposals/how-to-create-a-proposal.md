# How to create a proposal

If you don't know what a proposal is, read the [proposal explanation
doc](/features/proposals/what) first.

:::note

Members must join the DAO before a proposal is made in order to vote on it.
Membership changes during a proposal's voting period are ignored as they only
apply to future proposals.

:::

## Steps

To begin, starting from your DAO's page, navigate to **Proposals > New
Proposal**.

Then, fill in the proposal's name, description, and actions (if needed).

:::tip What is an action?

[Proposal actions](/features/proposals/what#actions) allow you to add rich
functionality to proposals: software instructions that execute on the blockchain
when a proposal is passed and executed. Read the [proposal
docs](/features/proposals/what) to learn more.

:::

If you want to create a multiple choice proposal, check out the [multiple choice
proposal docs](/features/proposals/types#multiple-choice).

To preview how the proposal will look once its created, press **Preview**.

Once you are satisfied with the proposal, press **Publish**. Your wallet will
prompt you to approve the transaction.

Once you approve it, your proposal will be live and the DAO members can vote on it!
