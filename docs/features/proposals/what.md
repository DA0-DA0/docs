# What are proposals?

Proposals are how DAOs take action. You can think of proposals as the nervous
system of the DAOâ€”members submit and vote on proposals, and if passed, the DAO
_does something_.

## What can proposals do?

Proposals can contain actions, which is where things get really interesting.
Actions are software instructions that get executed on the blockchain after a
proposal is passed. As a simple example: an action could pay a contributor by
transferring money from the DAO's treasury to their wallet. The purpose of the
DAO DAO UI is to make it easy to do this by abstracting away the technicalities
of the blockchain in an easy-to-use interface.

:::tip Examples

A blockchain software instruction could:

- Deploy a docker container on [Akash](https://akash.network/).
- [Update the
  configuration](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno10h0hc64jv006rr8qy0zhlu4jsxct8qwa0vtaleayh0ujz0zynf2s2r7v8q/proposals/A7)
  of a smart contract.
- Pay a [RPC node
  provider](https://daodao.zone/dao/juno1gpwekludv6vu8pkpnp2hwwf7f84a7mcvgm9t2cvp92hvpxk07kdq8z4xj2/proposals/A7).

Truly anything you can do on a blockchain is supported by DAO DAO DAOs, with the
added benefits of sophisticated governance processes.

## Voting on proposals

When you create a proposal, the voting distribution of members at the time of
proposal creation is snapshotted and used for the proposal. This means that if
you were not a member when a proposal was created, you will not be able to vote
on it.

This security measure prevents an attacker from purchasing a DAO's governance
token if it's listed on an exchange, manipulating a vote, and then selling the
tokens immediately afterward. Essentially, it ensures that a DAO member knows
_to whom_ they are making a proposal: the people who have voting power at the
moment the proposal goes live.
